According to legend The Gael descend mostly from Iberian Milesians.

 Once upon a time, a questing tribe followed Amergin son of Galamh mac Bile mac Brath Míl Espáine
 to a small Atlantic isle.
 The land ruled by a god tribe, Tuaithe Dé Dannan.
 Their king had dreamed of their approach with ill omen. His druids repelled Amergin's forces at first with a magical storm. 
                But Amergin was a poet and into the storm he spoke the words of Ireland's first poem:
 
 I am the wind which breaths upon the sea 
              I am the wave of the ocean I am the murmur of the billows,

 I am Stag of Seven Tines
              I am a Hawk on a Cliff
              I am a beam of the sun
              I am the fairest of plants,

 I am a word of science
               I am the point of the lance of battle,
 ...(I am) a Song on a Spear
               an Enchantment of Winds
                
 Defeated in 3 battles, Their kings were slain.
             

 The Dé Danann followed queens Banba Éiru 7 Fóladh to the otherworld so the story goes; 
hence the Fairy as we know them, today.
 Gaelic civilization flourished on an island far from Rome.
                ,

 1169CE: deposed Gaelic King Diarmait Mac Murchada solicited Norman Mercenaries to quell rebellion in Leinster
 King Henry II of England used this to declare the conquered cities 
            crown-land. So began 800 years of English rule in Ireland

 1580AD: Beseiged Gaelic Italian and Spanish forces were massacred at Ard na Caithne in Corca Dhuibhne, by lord Grey de Wilton. His aide, poet Edmund Spencer wrote to Queen Elizebeth, and explained why the Irish ever resisted English rule thus:


"Soe that the speach being Irish, 
            the hart must needes be Irishe; 
            for out of the aboundance of the hart, 
            the tonge speaketh"
            - A Veue of The Present State of Ireland

 1607CE: Gaelic Ireland's final strongholds fell and as the last Ulster chieftains were forced into exile, So ended the Gaelic order.

 Every generation revolted English Rule. No peace came.
 19th Century famine fell Irish silent. Yet again and again rebel hearts rose. 
                
		Language names destiny.
                
                Such is the power of love in gentle mind,
                That it can alter all the course of kind.
 
                -Edmund Spenser
